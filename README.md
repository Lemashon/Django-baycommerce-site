E-dairy hub is an online application that connects dairy farmers with their clients.
• Worked as a Python and Django developer responsible for creating high-quality code for the back-end of the site using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, MongoDB, Git and GitHub as the version control.
• Designed the back-end system, which allowed farmers to easily monitor requested orders and receive payments.
• Created a user-friendly site, on the front end, that enabled customers to sign up and place orders for their dairy products.

Customers were pleased with the ease of transactions when placing orders for their dairy goods. This resulted in the timely delivery of the items they had purchased. The dairy farmers also saw a larger customer base, which contributed to a significant increase in daily sales, approximately 3x the previous amount. This success of the project can be attributed to customer satisfaction and sales growth. Overall, the farmers experienced a positive outcome due to the ease of transactions and the expansion of their customer base.
